# CovidCNN
Boilerplate CNN trained on "imagized" data from the Mexican Covid-19 dataset.

Built Using:
 - python 3.7.6
 - pytorch 1.5.0+cpu
 - torchvision 0.6.0+cpu

To test, extract the test_net1.7z archive to test_net1.tar in the directory containing the script.

To train, contact me for details on setting up a DB based on the Mexican Covid data set.
